Fix for the following two CVE issues:

CVE-2013-4287 
Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in Gem::Version::VERSION_PATTERN in 
lib/rubygems/version.rb in RubyGems before 1.8.23.1, 1.8.24 through 1.8.25, 
2.0.x before 2.0.8, and 2.1.x before 2.1.0, as used in Ruby 1.9.0 through 
2.0.0p247, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU 
consumption) via a crafted gem version that triggers a large amount of 
backtracking in a regular expression. 

CVE-2013-4363 
Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in 
Gem::Version::ANCHORED_VERSION_PATTERN in lib/rubygems/version.rb in RubyGems

2.1.5, as used in Ruby 1.9.0 through 2.0.0p247, allows remote attackers to 
cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted gem version that 
triggers a large amount of backtracking in a regular expression. NOTE: this
